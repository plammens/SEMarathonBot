Hi, I'm the Stack Exchange Marathon Bot. A Stack Exchange marathon is a simple game: try to get as much reputation as you can in a given time frame. My purpose as bot is to track reputation changes of participants among a selected set of SE sites. Type /start to start listening for commands.

General commands:
 - /info -- Show this message
 - /start -- Start listening for commands

Marathon setup:
 - /new\_marathon -- Create new marathon with default settings
 - /settings -- Show active settings for the marathon
 - /add\_participants -- Add participants by username (as space separated arguments)
 - /set\_sites -- Set the SE sites to be tracked (by API identifier)
 - /set\_duration -- Set the duration of the marathon
 - /start\_marathon -- Start the marathon!
 
 Manage a running marathon:
 - /leaderboard -- Show the leaderboard
 - /time -- Show remaining time
 - /pause\_marathon -- Pause an ongoing marathon
 - /stop\_marathon -- Stop an ongoing marathon
